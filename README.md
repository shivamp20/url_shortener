# url_shortener
- as of now I have added short URL as fb for Facebook login page.
- to test the code you can run the code on localhost 3000 and hit url: localhost:3000/fb.
- this will lead to Facebook login page directly.
- I have also added provision for short URL which does not exist in database and will lead to error page.
- I will be updating rest soon
