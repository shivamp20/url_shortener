# url_shortener
- as of now I have added short URL as fb for Facebook login page.
- to test the code you can run the code on localhost 3000 and hit url: localhost:3000/fb.
- this will lead to Facebook login page directly.
- I have also added a cath block for short URL which does not exis in database and will lead to am error page.
